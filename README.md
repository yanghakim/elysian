## Elysian

Tentatively named "Elysian", this is a Christian Journaling application, intended to be available on mobile and web environments. It's part of a blooming startup idea that intends to use a well designed and engaging journaling application to offer compiled, physical journals that can be purchased and delivered to users. It brings together the artisanship and preciousness of having a physical journal and the accessibility and practicality of using an electronic journaling service.
